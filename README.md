# NYC-Citibike-Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to see if the Citibike operation may be feesible at another location. For this analysis, there is a Tableau story creating and can be reviewed using the following link.

I also have the images in the repo in case anything is wrong with the link. 

I have added additional information from Tableau to include the 2018 population and per income capita so that this information can be used with another analysis in the future for any location that could have possibilities for expanding into. 

## Results from the Analysis 

### Pick up Locations

The first graph shows Citibike locations with sizing by pick up count. This graph also includes the 2018 Population so we can try to get a better understanding to why these locations are used. From this map, we can see that the more densely poplated areas have a larger pick up count in comparison to the locations outside of the immediate city range. 

### Drop off Locations 

The second map is sized by count for drop off locations. I did include that Per Capita Income with this map so we can use this later to see if there is a correlation with that between this area and any area that may be a good fit for expanding into. Most of the locations are inside an area with the income being higher that 29.8k per year, the locations in a lower income area do not have the same volume as the higher income areas. 

### Trip Duration 

The third chart shows that the majority of the rentals have a trip duration of 5 minutes, and almost all of the rentals fall inside 30 minutes. This information can also be used to work with a starting point in an ideal area (most congested) and apply a radius around that area. 

### Trip Duration by Gender 

The fourth chart shows that the larger percentage of riders are male, followed by female then finally by "other". This is valuable information to compare to other locations to see if this can assist with guiding what locations/areas to expand in. 

### Usage Shown by Time of Day

The fifth graph shows the usage broken down by time of day across days of the week. We can see that the busiest times are those of "rush hour" when people are heading into work and leaving. The weekend is more evenly blended for usage pick up starting around 10am and slowing down around 7pm.

### Usage for Time of Day by Gender 

The sixth graph set shows the usage of time of day broken apart by gender. While the graphs are similar, the graph for males shows that the usage is higher but the patterns between males and females are similar. 

### Usage by Customer and Subscriber 

The seventh graph shows that the majority of users are subscribers. Male subscribers usage on Thursday is the highest and I think this should go deeper into an analysis to find out what is causing this. 

## Summary

The summary of this analysis is that we can see that male subcribers in a densly populated area where the income per capita is higher than 29.8k per year could be a good target. An analysis should be performed in advance for any location that this might be expanded to, at least for identifying similarities between locations before investing into expansion or start up.
